# MolModelling2019
Course projects

Each project has individual groups.  
I try to gather all the code I work with and use this repo as a platform for collaboration with the group on each project.  

Each project should have it's own folder to keep things organized. 

I use mainly python but I have some experience with Fortran also.  

Welcome to fork and collaborate on the Molecular modelling course projects.
